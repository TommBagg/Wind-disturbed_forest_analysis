# Wind-disturbed_forest_analysis
Analysis of forests disturbed by windstorm to assess their protection capacity against snow avalanches. 

The algorithms performed the stored volume height index and the adapted tree parameters (identifying the tree top and crown area). They have been implemented to assess protection capacity of windthrown forests even on large areas surveyed by point cloud (e.g. LiDAR or photogramettric derived). The two algorithms peroformed the relative analysis for every polygon feature given by a shapefile layer (identifying the areas of interest or the potential release areas).
